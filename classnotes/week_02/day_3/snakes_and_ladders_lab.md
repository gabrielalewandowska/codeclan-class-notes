# Pair Programming Lab - Snakes and Ladders

In pairs, implement a game of Snakes and Ladders in Ruby. 

Look at each other's plans from yesterday, and either choose the one you both prefer or put together a new plan with the best parts of both.

Work one one laptop and Git commit regularly - we will show you how to get a copy of the code onto the other laptop at the end of the day. 

Remember to use TDD!

TIP:
It may be easiest to focus on making the simplest possible version of the game first - i.e. a board with players who move along it. Then add more functionality as you go along, such as the ability to win by reaching a certain position, and then the snakes and ladders.
