Your homework this evening is to continue with your pizza shop website from the lesson & lab today. Finish off all 7 of the RESTful routes, add some CSS, add more links to allow users to navigate your entire site more easily. Just try things out and experiment, in the Ruby code and in the HTML & CSS.
