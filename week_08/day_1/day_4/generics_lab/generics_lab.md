# Lab - Generics

## Objectives
- practice writing a generic class in Java.

## Library class

Your task is to create a class to implement a simple library. The library can contain items of any type, but of one type only e.g. it can only contain Books. Thus you will need to make the class a generic class where you pass in the type of the item the library contains.

The library class should have methods to do the following:

- add an new item to the library
- issue an item to a borrower
- return an item from a borrower
