# Paired programming Lab for SOLID

We would like you, in pairs, to create an application allowing athletes to track their runs and to compete under various criteria.

Athletes should be able to record a list of their runs. Each run should have distance, time and altitude gain. Athletes should start with no runs and be able to add them.

## Competitions
Competitions should be able to add athletes, and then show the winner.  Competitions will have different criteria to decide who is the winner.  These are the criteria we would currently like to have.

  1. Longest distance covered.
  2. Fastest average speed.
  3. Most altitude climbed.

This list may well change/grow in the future. For example fastest 10k.

TDD please.
